I will be keeping the small projects I do following along with youtube videos, etc.  
I follow along and type every character. Often I don't know what I am typing, but I look it up eventually. I have found this keeps my focus better than dry reading with trial and error. _I deal with enough of that in school_.  
  
All of the directories in this repository are submodules (accept one right now). I just learned about them, and I am going to use them for a bit. See what breaks.
